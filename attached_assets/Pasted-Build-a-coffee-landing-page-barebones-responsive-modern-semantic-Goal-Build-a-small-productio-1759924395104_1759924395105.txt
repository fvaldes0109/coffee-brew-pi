Build a coffee landing page (barebones, responsive, modern, semantic)
Goal
 Build a small, production-ready landing page for a coffee business. Deliver separate index.html, styles.css, and script.js files (no bundlers, no frameworks). The result must be visually polished, accessible, responsive, and follow the exact constraints below.
Project structure (required)
/index.html
/styles.css
/script.js
/assets/
  /icons.svg (optional)
  /hero.jpg (optional placeholder)

High-level requirements
Topic: coffee — use imagery and text appropriate for a small coffee business / roastery / café.


Semantic HTML only: use <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>. No non-semantic containers except when appropriate (e.g., <div> for layout).


Styling: pure hand-written CSS only. No Tailwind, Bootstrap, shadcn, or any CSS frameworks.


JavaScript: vanilla only. Keep it minimal (e.g., mobile nav toggle, a11y helpers). No React / Vue / Angular / frontend frameworks.


Deliver clean, well-commented, production-ready code.


Design direction & UX
Color palette: dark — provide a refined dark palette (deep coffee/brown, charcoal, muted gold/cream accent). Provide CSS variable names and hex values in :root.


Overall style: modern, geometric art direction, professional tone, sans-serif typography.


Layout personality: centered single column (content centered with max-width).


Spacing: compact and dense (tight rhythm but readable).


Buttons & links: subtle ghost buttons (transparent background, thin border, subtle hover).


Imagery approach: minimal icons (inline SVGs), 1 hero image or tasteful geometric coffee illustration.


Motion: smooth & subtle (micro-interactions, hover transitions, gentle reveal animation).


HTML/Accessibility requirements
Use semantic landmarks: header, main, section(s), footer.


Include a skip-to-content link for keyboard users.


Header must contain site name/logo (inline SVG or text) + simple nav (Home, Menu, About, Contact).


Hero section: heading, subheading, CTA button (primary), a short supporting paragraph.


Footer: copyright, minimal links (privacy, terms).


Use meaningful alt text for images. Provide ARIA attributes where needed (e.g., aria-expanded for mobile menu).


Ensure focus styles are visible and high-contrast.


Keyboard navigation must be fully usable (tab order, close mobile menu with Esc).


Provide semantic headings (H1 only once, correct hierarchy).


CSS technical requirements (must follow)
Minimal reset: * { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; }.


Use CSS variables in :root for colors, fonts, spacing, radii, etc.


Fluid typography using clamp() for the main heading and base text.


Mobile-first with media queries for larger breakpoints.


Use Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout where appropriate.


Use logical properties (e.g., margin-inline, padding-block) for spacing.


Use aspect-ratio for consistent media sizing (hero image/media).


Use svh/lvh/dvh or modern viewport units to account for mobile browser UI.


Smooth transitions for hover/focus states (e.g., transition: transform .22s ease, box-shadow .22s ease).


Dark/light mode support using prefers-color-scheme — default to dark, but provide light mode adjustments.


Accessible hover & focus: high contrast and visible outlines. Focus should not be removed.


Use compact/dense spacing (tight vertical rhythm) but retain readability.


JavaScript requirements
Single script.js file.


Minimal behavior:


Toggle mobile navigation (add/remove aria-expanded, animate slide/fade).


Close mobile nav on Esc key.


Optionally: smooth-scroll to sections for anchor links (no polyfills required).


No external libraries. Keep logic small and well-commented.


Imagery & icons
Use inline SVGs for logo and small icons (no external icon libraries).


If using photos, use a single hero image in /assets/hero.jpg (can be a placeholder). If the agent cannot fetch images, use a tasteful CSS background gradient + geometric SVG illustration as placeholder.


Provide descriptive alt text for images (e.g., alt="Barista steaming milk over an espresso machine").


Deliverable expectations
index.html — semantic markup, comments explaining structure and accessibility considerations, links to CSS and JS.


styles.css — well-structured, commented sections (root variables, reset, layout, components, utilities, theme toggles).


script.js — minimal vanilla JS with comments and short functions.


README.md — short instructions how to preview (open index.html), notes about accessibility testing performed, color palette, and files list.


Commit history: a few small commits (e.g., init: add base HTML, feat: add responsive styles and hero, chore: add mobile nav script) — if agent uses git on Replit.


Testing & accessibility checks (instructions for agent)
Keyboard test: Tab through header/nav, open/close mobile menu, ensure focus is visible and order logical.


Color contrast: Ensure text meets at least WCAG AA contrast with background (especially the hero heading and CTA).


Semantic checks: H1 present and unique, landmark elements present.


Mobile responsiveness: test at 375px, 768px, 1024px. Ensure hero image respects aspect ratio and content remains centered single-column.


ARIA: mobile menu reports aria-expanded="true|false", icons have aria-hidden where appropriate.


Performance: CSS should be compact and selective; avoid huge images.


Production-ready requirements (non-negotiable)
No external CSS or JS frameworks.


No CDN assets unless essential — prefer inline SVGs and small local assets.


Comments: all files must be commented explaining why choices were made (especially CSS variable choices, breakpoints, and JS behaviors).


Code must be valid HTML5 and no console errors.


Sample design tokens (suggested — agent may choose final values but follow same names)
:root{
  --bg: #0b0a0a;
  --surface: #161415;
  --muted: #bfb6aa;
  --accent: #cfa06b; /* warm golden */
  --accent-2: #7a4b2a; /* coffee brown */
  --text: #f6f3f0;
  --radius: 10px;
  --gap: 0.75rem;
  --measure: 65ch;
  --ff: 'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
}

Use clamp() for font sizes, e.g.: font-size: clamp(1rem, 1.8vw, 1.125rem); for body, clamp(1.8rem, 5.6vw, 3.2rem) for H1.


Micro-interactions
CTA and nav links: subtle scale/translate on hover and focus with will-change: transform.


Small entrance animation for hero text (fade+translate-up), but keep prefers-reduced-motion respected.


Acceptance checklist to include in the final response
Files: index.html, styles.css, script.js, README.md, /assets present.


Semantic HTML with header/main/section/footer.


CSS variables and clamp() typography.


Mobile-first responsive layout (Flexbox/Grid).


Logical properties used.


aspect-ratio for media.


Dark/light mode via prefers-color-scheme.


Accessible focus states, alt text, ARIA for menu.


Minimal JS: mobile nav toggle + Esc to close + keyboard-friendly.


Well-commented code and README with preview instructions.


Optional but appreciated
Provide one small inline CSS-only decorative geometric SVG (as background/hero accent).


Include a small prefers-reduced-motion fallback for users who opt out of motion.


Provide brief notes in README about how to swap images, change palette, and extend the site.
